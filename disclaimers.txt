Disclaimers: 

-all values are approximate
-certain functions cannot accept values which are
 outside graph boundaries (it is possible to change
 these boundaries under settings)
-if your graph is not continuous, accurate results
 are not guaranteed; in fact, errors are likely
-if you enter an invalid expression, the program will
 still run - however, the result will not be what
 you intend
-USE RESPONSIBLY (if you try to create errors, then 
 you will get errors)
