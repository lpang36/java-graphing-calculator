Specific functions supported by the graphing calculator tab:

The following can be accessed via the menu.

Trace - given a value x, returns f(x)
Minimum - given an upper and lower bound, returns the minimum value
Maximum - given an upper and lower bound, returns the maximum value
Zeros - given an upper and lower bound, attempts to find any zeros
	within that range (if there are multiple zeros, the lowest 
	zero will be returned)
Derivative - given a value x, returns df(x)/dx
Integral - given an upper and lower bound, returns the definite
	   integral with the bounds as a and b

All values are approximate.
